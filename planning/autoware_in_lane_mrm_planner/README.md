# autoware_in_lane_mrm_planner

MRM in-lane stop trajectory planner (Phase1).

## Design

See `docs/design_phase1.md` and `docs/implementation_plan_phase1.md`.

## Build

From `pilot-auto.x2.v4.3.2` repository root (after workspace dependencies are installed):

```bash
./cmd_helper.sh --build_ccache --packages-select autoware_in_lane_mrm_planner
```

Do not run package builds in parallel with a full workspace build.

## Launch

```bash
ros2 launch autoware_in_lane_mrm_planner in_lane_mrm_planner.launch.xml
```

## Debug topic: planner status

Published every control cycle to explain why `~/output/trajectory` was or was not published.

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| Topic (node) | `~/debug/planner_status` |
| Default remap | `/planning/in_lane_mrm_planner/debug/planner_status` |
| Domain 1 (vehicle, via bridge) | `/mrm/planning/in_lane_mrm_planner/debug/planner_status` |
| Type | `autoware_internal_debug_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArrayStamped` |

Use `data[0]` as the primary reason code when plotting in PlotJuggler or post-processing rosbags.
Other fields are boolean flags (0/1) or numeric diagnostics.

### `data[]` layout

| Index | Field | Unit / type | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | `reason_code` | int | Primary status (see table below) |
| 1 | `trigger_active` | 0/1 | MRM trigger is true |
| 2 | `is_latched` | 0/1 | Trajectory latch is active |
| 3 | `has_latest_candidate` | 0/1 | A candidate trajectory is stored in the latcher |
| 4 | `data_ready` | 0/1 | Map, route, odometry, and acceleration are available |
| 5 | `plan_ok` | 0/1 | Path planning succeeded this cycle (non-latched mode only) |
| 6 | `validation_ok` | 0/1 | Trajectory validator passed (non-latched mode only) |
| 7 | `planned_points` | count | Trajectory point count after plan/smooth/modifier/velocity |
| 8 | `published_points` | count | Point count of the trajectory actually published (0 if none) |
| 9 | `cycle_time_ms` | ms | Wall time for this timer callback |
| 10 | `odom_vx` | m/s | Longitudinal velocity from input odometry |

### `reason_code` values

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | `published_ok` | Non-latched mode: planned, validated, and published |
| 1 | `waiting_map` | Missing `~/input/vector_map` |
| 2 | `waiting_route` | Missing `~/input/route` |
| 3 | `waiting_odometry` | Missing `~/input/kinematic_state` |
| 4 | `waiting_accel` | Missing `~/input/acceleration` |
| 10 | `plan_failed_update_current_lanelet` | Ego pose not on route lanelets |
| 11 | `plan_failed_backward_lanelets` | Failed to extend lanelets backward on route |
| 12 | `plan_failed_forward_lanelets` | Failed to extend lanelets forward on route |
| 13 | `plan_failed_invalid_s_range` | Invalid path range (`s_end <= s_start`) |
| 14 | `plan_failed_generate_path` | Path generation failed (empty lanelet, no points, crop failed, etc.) |
| 15 | `plan_failed_no_output` | Plan/validation succeeded but no trajectory to publish |
| 20 | `validation_failed_point_count` | Validator: fewer than `min_point_count` points (also covers empty) |
| 21 | `validation_failed_non_finite` | Validator: non-finite pose/velocity/acceleration |
| 30 | `latched_output_published` | Latched mode: publishing frozen trajectory |
| 31 | `latched_without_candidate` | Latched mode: no candidate stored (nothing published) |
| 99 | `unknown` | Fallback / unclassified |

Codes are defined in `src/in_lane_mrm_planner_node.cpp` (`StatusReasonCode`).

The validator is a publish-gate sanity check only (point count and finite values).
Trajectory shape and longitudinal feasibility are owned by obstacle-stop and the
velocity planner, not the validator.

### Correlating with follower target speed drops

If `reason_code` is not `0` or `30`, or `published_points` is 0 while the vehicle is moving,
`~/output/trajectory` was not updated that cycle. The longitudinal follower then keeps the
previous reference, which can make target speed appear to drop to zero in diagnostics.

## Dependencies

- Path / obstacle-stop logic: vendored from `pilot-auto.x2.v4.3.e2e` (see `docs/*_sync.md`)
- EB smoothing: `autoware_path_smoother` (v4.3.2 workspace)
