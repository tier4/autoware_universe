# Autoware Diffusion Planner

## Overview

The **Autoware Diffusion Planner** is a trajectory generation module for autonomous vehicles, designed to work within the [Autoware](https://autoware.org/) ecosystem. It leverages the [Diffusion Planner](https://github.com/ZhengYinan-AIR/Diffusion-Planner) model, as described in the paper ["Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15564) by Zheng et al. <!-- cSpell:ignore Zheng -->

This planner generates smooth, feasible, and safe trajectories by considering:

- Dynamic and static obstacles
- Vehicle kinematics
- User-defined constraints
- Lanelet2 map context
- Traffic signals and speed limits

It is implemented as a ROS 2 component node, making it easy to integrate into Autoware-based stacks. The node is aimed at working within the proposed [Autoware new planning framework](https://github.com/tier4/new_planning_framework).

## ‚ùó Limitations

While the Diffusion Planner shows promising capabilities, there are several limitations to be aware of:

- **Route Termination**:
  The route input to the model consists of a sequence of preferred lanelets from the current position to the goal region. However, **this route does not necessarily end exactly at the goal position**. As a result, the ego vehicle **may continue driving past the goal** instead of stopping at the target location.

- **Training Dataset Domain Gap**:
  The provided diffusion model checkpoint was trained on datasets using a **proprietary Lanelet2 map that is not publicly available**. Consequently, **performance may significantly degrade when running on other maps**, especially in environments with different topology or tagging conventions.

- **Route Adherence & Lane Changing**:
  The model sometimes **fails to strictly follow the preferred lanelet route**. If the ego vehicle leaves the preferred lane (e.g., to avoid an obstacle), it tends to **only return to the route during curves**. It **seldom performs deliberate lane changes** to merge back into the correct route on straight segments.

- **Agent and Obstacle Avoidance**:
  Although the planner **reacts to other agents and can perform avoidance maneuvers**, this behavior is **not fully reliable**. In some cases, **collisions with static or dynamic obstacles may still occur** due to ignored agents or insufficient context comprehension.

- **Lack of Static Object Context**:
  Static environment context such as **traffic cones, guard rails, or construction barriers** is **not currently provided to the model**. Instead, an **empty tensor** is passed in their place, which can lead to **limited understanding of occlusions or drivable boundaries**.
