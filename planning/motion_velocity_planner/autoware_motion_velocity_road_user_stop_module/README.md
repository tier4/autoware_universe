# Road User Stop

## Role

The `road_user_stop` module stops the ego vehicle when pedestrians, cyclists, or other road users are detected on or near the road within the ego's planned trajectory. This module ensures safe interaction with vulnerable road users by maintaining appropriate stopping distances and making intelligent decisions about when to stop versus when to continue driving.

## Activation

This module is activated if the launch parameter `launch_road_user_stop_module` is set to true.
