# tier4_dummy_object_rviz_plugin

## Purpose

This plugin is used to generate dummy pedestrians, cars, and obstacles in planning simulator.

## Overview

The CarInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy car.
The PedestrianInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy pedestrian.
The UnknownInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy obstacle.
The StaticInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating dummy static-area point clouds with a `PointCloudClassification` label.
The DeleteAllObjectsTool deletes the dummy cars, pedestrians, obstacles, and static area point clouds.

The StaticInitialPoseTool uses `tier4_simulation_msgs::msg::DummyObject` on a dedicated static area topic. On this topic only, `classification.label` stores a `PointCloudClassification` value.

## Assumptions / Known limits

Using a planning simulator

## Usage

1. Start rviz and select + on the tool tab.
   ![select_add](./images/select_add.png)
2. Select one of the following: tier4_dummy_object_rviz_plugin and press OK.
   ![select_plugin](./images/select_plugin.png)
3. Select the new item in the tool tab (2D Dummy Car in the example) and click on it in rviz.
   ![select_dummy_car](./images/select_dummy_car.png)

### Interactive manipulation

You can interactively manipulate the object.

1. Select "Tool Properties" in rviz.
2. Select the corresponding object tab in the Tool Properties.
3. Turn the "Interactive" checkbox on.
   ![tool_properties](./images/tool_properties.png)
4. Select the item in the tool tab in you haven't chosen yet.
5. Key commands are as follows.

| action | key command                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ADD    | Shift + Click Right Button             |
| MOVE   | Hold down Right Button + Drag and Drop |
| DELETE | Alt + Click Right Button               |

### Static pose

You can place a static box for semantic point cloud generation.

1. Select "2D Dummy Static Area" in the tool tab.
2. Select a non-object-compatible class from `Point Class` in the Tool Properties.
3. Set `Length`, `Width`, and `Height` in the Tool Properties.
4. Click and drag in RViz like the other 2D dummy object tools.

The tool publishes `tier4_simulation_msgs::msg::DummyObject` with `shape.type = BOUNDING_BOX`.
Only on the static area topic, `classification.label` is interpreted as
`autoware::point_types::PointCloudClassification`.
Object-compatible `PointCloudClassification` labels are not shown in `Point Class`.
`DeleteAllObjectsTool` also publishes `DELETEALL` to the static area topic, so static area point
clouds are cleared together with dummy objects.
