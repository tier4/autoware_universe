# Planning Evaluator

## Purpose

This package provides nodes that generate various metrics to evaluate the quality of planning.

Metrics can be published in real time and saved to a JSON file when the node is shut down:

- `metrics_for_publish`:

  - Metrics listed in `metrics_for_publish` are calculated and published to the topic.

- `metrics_for_output`:
  - Metrics listed in `metrics_for_output` are saved to a JSON file when the node shuts down (if `output_metrics` is set to `true`).
  - These metrics include statistics derived from `metrics_for_publish` and additional information such as parameters and descriptions.

## Metrics

All possible metrics are defined in the `Metric` enumeration located in:

- `include/autoware/planning_evaluator/metrics/metric.hpp`
- `include/autoware/planning_evaluator/metrics/output_metric.hpp`

These files also provide string conversions and human-readable descriptions for use in output files.

### Metric Classifications

#### By Data Type

1. **Statistics-based Metrics**:

   - Calculated using `autoware_utils::Accumulator`, which tracks minimum, maximum, mean, and count values.
   - Sub-metrics: `/mean`, `/min`, `/max`, and `/count`.

2. **Value-based Metrics**:

   - Metrics with a single value.
   - Sub-metrics: `/value`.
   - Some metrics with older implementations use the statistics-based format of `/mean`, `/min`, `/max`, but all values are the same.

3. **Count-based Metrics**:
   - Count occurrences of specific events over a time period.
   - Sub-metrics: `/count`, or `/count_in_duration`.

## Parameters

{{ json_to_markdown("evaluator/autoware_planning_evaluator/schema/autoware_planning_evaluator.schema.json") }}

## Assumptions / Known limits

There is a strong assumption that when receiving a trajectory `T(0)`,
it has been generated using the last received reference trajectory and objects.
This can be wrong if a new reference trajectory or objects are published while `T(0)` is being calculated.

Precision is currently limited by the resolution of the trajectories.
It is possible to interpolate the trajectory and reference trajectory to increase precision but would make computation significantly more expensive.

## Future extensions / Unimplemented parts

- Use `Route` or `Path` messages as reference trajectory.
- RSS metrics (done in another node <https://tier4.atlassian.net/browse/AJD-263>).
- `motion_evaluator_node`.
  - Node which constructs a trajectory over time from the real motion of ego.
  - Only a proof of concept is currently implemented.
- Take into account the shape, not only the centroid of the object for the obstacle metrics.
